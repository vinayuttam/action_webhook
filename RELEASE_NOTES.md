## 🚀 Quick Start

```ruby

  def user_created
    @user = params[:user]
    endpoints = [{ url: 'https://api.example.com/webhooks' }]
    deliver(endpoints)
  end
end

# 2. Create a template (app/webhooks/user_webhook/user_created.json.erb)
{
  "event": "user.created",
  "user": { "id": <%= @user.id %>, "email": "<%= @user.email %>" }
}

UserWebhook.user_created(user: @user).deliver_later

3. **Flexible** - Support for multiple endpoints, custom headers, and complex payloads
